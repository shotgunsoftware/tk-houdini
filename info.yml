        type: bool
        description: "Controls whether a menu will be built with commands
                     registered by the installed apps. It is not currently
                     possible to rebuild the menu on a Shotgun context switch,
                     so this option allows for the menu to be disabled in
                     favor of the Shotgun shelf which can be rebuilt
                     dynamically."

                     and each menu item is a dictionary with keys app_instance and name.
                     The app_instance parameter connects this entry to a particular
                     app instance defined in the environment configuration file. The name
                     is a menu name to make a favourite."
