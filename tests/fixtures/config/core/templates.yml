# This file is one of the central points in the Tank configuration and a counterpart to
# the folder configuration structure.
#
# the folder structure underneath the project folder is used to create folders on disk -
# templates.yml (this file) refers to those folders. Therefore, the two files need to be
# in sync. This file contains an overview of all locations that are used in Tank.
#
#
# Whenever an app or an engine refers to a location on disk, it is using a entry defined in
# this file. For more information, see the Tank Documentation.
