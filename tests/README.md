# Running Houdini engine tests

To run these tests, you need to do the following (tested on Mac)

1. From a terminal, create a virtual environment (using `virtualenv` even on newer versions of Python) at the specific location of `tests/venv_py3` depending on the version of python you are testing.
To create a virtual env for Python 3 do something like this:

```
virtualenv --python=/Users/username/.pyenv/versions/3.7.6/bin/python3 venv_py3
```

2. Activate the virtual environment.

```
source venv_p3/bin/activate
```

3. Install all dependencies needed for the test:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. In the command line, set the `HOUDINI_PATH` env var to point to this test folder:

```
export HOUDINI_PATH="/Users/philips1/source_code/tk-houdini/tests;&"
```

on Mac, or

```
set "HOUDINI_PATH=E:\code\tk-houdini\tests;&"
```

on Windows, (make sure you include the `;&` at the end and wrap the value in quotes.)

5. Launch Houdini via the same terminal you set the env var in. Houdini should have a valid license enabled.

```
/Applications/Houdini/Houdini18.0.392/Houdini\ FX\ 18.0.392.app/Contents/MacOS/houdini
```

It should then run the tests and dump the output to the shell and then close Houdini automatically.

> To run the tests via hython (to test without a UI) do everything the same, but instead of calling the Houdini app call hython: `/Applications/Houdini/Houdini18.0.348/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/18.0/Resources/bin/hython`.
